# Simple whereis command

This is a very simple `whereis` command imitation, that is designed for
simplicity, and easy maintenance. And also some C functions you can use
for your own project.

### Why does this exist?

The builtin `whereis` command for macOS sometimes does not work probably,
like for linked commands, or commands in other paths (these issues may have
been fix already). And this project also provides some functions you might
want for your own project. _This also works for linux._

## Install

Want to try this? Install the `whereis` command by either:

 1. Cloning the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/WestleyR/whereis
cd whereis/
make
sudo make install
```

 2. Or using the [gpack](https://github.com/WestleyR/gpack) package manager: (beta)

```
gpack install WestleyR/whereis
```
